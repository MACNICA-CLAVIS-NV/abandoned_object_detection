--------

This application was inherited the TensorRT based YOLO implementation from [jkjung-avt](https://github.com/jkjung-avt)/[tensorrt_demos](https://github.com/jkjung-avt/tensorrt_demos). The software is under the MIT license.
I referenced source code of [NVIDIA/TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT) samples to develop most of the demos in this repository.  Those NVIDIA samples are under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/blob/master/LICENSE).
